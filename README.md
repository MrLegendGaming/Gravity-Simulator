# GRAVITY SIMULATOR

This is a simple gravity simulator I created using OpenGL in C++. For different results change the "newPositions[]" input and the "initialSpeed[]" in the "void main()" function (on top of the main while loop). Feel free to change other variables if you understand the code however, I cannot guarantee the expected results. This is not optimized but it can simulate over 10,000 particles at a reasonable speed.
